This repository is a final project for the Computational Physics course at Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Science, Physics major.

The goal of our machine learning model is to **"Classify F1 drivers' racing styles."**  
Our model isn't complete yet, still needs a lot of work.  
But since we're just petite physics students who never touched coding before, **we tried our best** ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

We have many team members who can't access the repository directly,  
so we need to keep it **public** for them.

If you see any mistakes, missteps, or issues, feel free to educate us!  
We would love to learn from the experts !
