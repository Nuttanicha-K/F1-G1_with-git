This repository is a final project for the Computational Physics course at Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Science, Physics major.

The goal of our machine learning model is to **"Classify F1 drivers' racing styles."**  
Even if our model has done, it might have a lots of change and develop in the future.
Our final model in file called **"Final Model"**.
Any conditions that appeared in the model can be change freely 
eg. Dry race, Rainy race, or Features
And since we're just petite physics students who never touched coding before, **we tried our best** ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

If you see any mistakes, missteps, or issues, feel free to educate us!  
We would love to learn from the experts !

We have many team members who can't access the repository directly,  
so we need to keep it **public** for them.

### Acknowledgement 
We would like to express our deepest gratitude to the following individuals who have been 
instrumental in the successful completion of our machine learning project
*Professor Napat Poovinitkul* : Thank you for your invaluable teaching and for assigning us challenging project. 
Your guidance has been crucial in helping us build and understand machine learning models.
*P'Ami, our Supervisor*: We are immensely grateful for your continuous advice and support throughout this project. 
Your insights have been incredibly helpful.
*theOehrly*: We extend our thanks to you for developing the Fast-F1 library, which made it significantly easier for us 
to access and analyze the data needed for our model.
*Our Team Members*: A heartfelt thank you to each one of you for your dedication and hard work. 
Spending countless hours together, including those intense 24-hour sessions, and creating numerous versions of our 
model has been a remarkable journey. Your commitment and teamwork have been truly inspiring.
